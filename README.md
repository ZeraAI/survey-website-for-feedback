# Feedback for a sample website
Every good developer needs feedback. Feedbacks help us grow, improve, 
and learn how to serve our clients better.

And if we are to earn our client's trust and respect, as well as their valuable time, 
it is up to us to create an awesome experience when requesting feedback.

Nobody wants to look at a boring template feedback site.

Let's give them something better.

And let's make it accessible.
